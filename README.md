Go to the [release section](https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/releases/) on Github to download the binaries for a productive use of the software.
The master branch of this repository contains the latest commits which were already tested and **should** work, but are not officially released yet.

## Compile and run Cantara manually

If you would like to compile the latest not stable state in the master branch, you need to do the following:

 1. Download and install the [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org) â€“ either via your distribution or their homepage.
 2. Clone the Github repository with its submodules (they are needed for building):

    `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:reckel-jm/cantara.git`

 3. Open the `lazarus.lpi` file *as a project* in Lazarus and compile it **or** use `lazbuild` for the compilation via the command line to compile the used packages first and then compile the Cantara project itself:

   `lazbuild -B src/bgrabitmap/bgrabitmap/bgrabitmappack.lpk && lazbuild -B src/metadarkstyle/metadarkstyle.lpk && lazbuild -B src/Cantara.lpi && lazbuild -B src/Cantara.lpi`

On Linux, you can change the used graphical framework via the `--ws=qt6` `--ws=qt5` or `--ws=gtk2` option. In addition, you can build the projekt via `make`.

> [!WARNING]
> The state of the master branch is not stable and not ready for productive use! If you want a stable version, please go to the [releases section](releases/).

## Song templates
Please consult the [documentation](https://www.cantara.app/tutorial/where-to-get-the-songs/) for learning which song formats are supported and where to get songs from.

At the moment an other [GitHub Repository with public domain Christian song lyrics is under construction](https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara_songrepo), which can be directly imported to Cantara.

## Settings
The color, background and font of the presentation can be changed in the settings.
